# QGIS_boundbox
A QGIS model which gives bound box of all the polygons in a shapefile. Bound box in the sense represents xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax. After running the output one will get a shapefile with coloumns - North, South, East and West representing the latter mentioned limits. Note: Model does not works below QGIS 3.16.
 A detailed tutorial on how to use this plugin will be available soon in [my blog](https://arungopi.gitlab.io).
